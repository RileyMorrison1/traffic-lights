# traffic-lights
This project was to design traffic lights that can work in different scenarios. 

# Scenarios
- Single road with pedestrian crossing
- T intersection (Not completed)
- Cross intersection (Not completed)

# Traffic Light Design
Each traffic light has three LEDs to display green, yellow and red colours. They also have a button that can be pressed by pedestrians that wish to cross the road. Once the button is pressed a beeping noise is made to notify that they pressed the button. When the pedestrians can cross the road a louder beeping noise is made to notify them that they can cross the road. This beeping noise is made by passive buzzer.

Resources Per Traffic Light
- 1 Green LED
- 1 Yellow LED
- 1 Red LED
- 3 330 ohm resistors
- 1 Passive buzzer
- 1 Push button
- Appropriate wires
- Compatible Arduino

# Further Improvements to Design

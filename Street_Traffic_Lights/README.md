# Street Traffic Lights
This project was to implement traffic lights using an Arduino. The sample scenario was a single road with a pedestrian crossing. The pedestrians could press a button on the traffic lights and wait until the lights go red, so they can cross the road. This scenario is laying the foundation to more complicated scenarios.
